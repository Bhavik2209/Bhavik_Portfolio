## Projects
### Olympics Data Analysis
 - The Olympics Data Analysis project uses Python, including tools like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and Streamlit, to study
   historical Olympic Games data. By analyzing the data and creating visualizations, we learn about the number of medals
   won by different countries and in various sports, as well as information about the athletes. This project is available as a
   web app through Streamlit Cloud.

### Stress Detection Analysis
 - Stress detection using the various parameters of our daily lives like steps count, heart rate, BP, Sleep Quality, Physical 
   Activity etc. The predicted stress level provided by this app is on a scale from 3 to 8, where 3 indicates low stress and 8 
   indicates high stress. However, it's essential to interpret the results with caution and seek professional advice if necessary.
